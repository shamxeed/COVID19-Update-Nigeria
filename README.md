# COVID19-Update-Nigeria

This is a simple web application that uses API to fetch Covid-19 data within Nigeria, country in western Africa.  
I built it when I was learning Ajax/Json, so I used Ajax to fetch the API and in return I got Json and displayed  
it on the screen using some other techniques.
